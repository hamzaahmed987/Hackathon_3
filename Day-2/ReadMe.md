# 🚀 Day 2 - System Design & Integration: Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025

Welcome to Day 2 of my **Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025** journey! 🎉 On this day, I transitioned from business-focused planning to technical preparation, focusing on designing the overall system architecture and defining integrations between the frontend, backend, and third-party APIs.

---

## 🛠️ System Design Overview

The system is designed to be a robust and scalable platform where the frontend interacts seamlessly with the backend. The goal is to provide users with a dynamic, user-friendly shopping experience for a wide range of products, including Nike shoes.

## 🎯 Frontend-Backend Integration

- **Frontend Framework:**
  - Built using **Next.js** for dynamic, server-side rendering and seamless UI performance.
  - Styled with **Tailwind CSS** to ensure responsive and modern design.
  - State management handled via **Redux** for predictable and scalable data flow.

- **Backend:**
  - **Sanity.io** CMS to manage product, order, and customer data.
  - RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for the frontend.

- **Communication:**
  - The frontend communicates with the backend via HTTP requests, using well-defined API endpoints.

### 🌐 Third-Party API Integration

The system integrates third-party APIs to handle essential marketplace features:

#### Third-Party API Details:

- **Purpose:**
  - Enable shipment tracking, secure payment processing, and real-time product availability updates.

- **Integration Flow:**
  - The frontend sends requests to the backend.
  - The backend interacts with third-party APIs for required data or services.
  - Results are returned to the frontend for display to users.

- **Security:**
  - Ensure secure communication through HTTPS and API key-based authentication.

### 📊 API Routes Definition

| **Endpoint**          | **Method** | **Purpose**                            |
|-----------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| `/api/products`       | GET        | Fetches a list of all available products. |
| `/api/order`          | POST       | Creates a new order and processes it via third-party payment gateway. |
| `/api/order/:id`      | GET        | Retrieves details of a specific order by its ID. |
| `/api/order/:id`      | PUT        | Updates the status of an order (e.g., shipped, delivered). |
| `/api/shipment`       | GET        | Tracks shipment status via third-party API. |
| `/api/payment/verify` | GET        | Verifies payment status securely.       |

## 💡 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux
- **Backend:** Sanity.io
- **API Integration:** Third-party APIs for payment and shipment tracking
- **Authentication:** Secure login and transactions via authentication libraries

## 📃 Documenting the Flow

The document outlines the data flow between components:

1. **Frontend:** Sends API requests to the backend for data retrieval or actions.
2. **Backend:** Processes the requests, interacts with the CMS or third-party APIs, and sends responses back.
3. **Frontend:** Dynamically updates the UI based on the received responses.

### 📊 Data Structure Visualization

The data structure includes entities like products, orders, customers, and vendors. Relationships are designed to ensure clear and scalable management of marketplace data:

- **Products:** ID, Name, Price, Stock, Description, Category.
- **Orders:** Order ID, Customer Info, Product Details, Status.
- **Customers:** ID, Name, Email, Address, Order History.
- **Vendors:** Vendor ID, Name, Contact Info, Product Listings.

## 📝 Next Steps

The next phase focuses on:

1. Implementing the planned API routes.
2. Integrating third-party services for payment and shipment tracking.
3. Starting frontend development to connect all the system components.

## 🚀 Day 2 Summary

Today, I designed the system architecture, outlined data flow between components, and planned third-party API integrations. These steps lay the foundation for a fully functional marketplace, bringing the vision of a scalable e-commerce platform closer to reality.
